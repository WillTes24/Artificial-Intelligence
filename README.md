# Car Classifier Using Rule-Based Algorithms

This is my code for the Rule-Based AI Scientific Research Paper assessment for the AI module on my uni course.
It is a simple Python program that classifies cars based on a set of rules. Using **two rule-based classifiers** it evaluates their performance against a labeled dataset.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **rule-based classification system** for cars using their attributes, such as:

- Buying price
- Maintenance cost
- Number of doors
- Passenger capacity
- Luggage boot size
- Safety rating

The program reads the dataset, classifies each car using two separate rule sets, and prints the accuracy of each classifier.

## Features

- Load and parse the car dataset (`car.data`)  
- Two independent rule-based classifiers: `rule_based_classifier_1` and `rule_based_classifier_2`  
- Evaluate predictions against actual labels and calculate accuracy  
- Prints detailed classification results for each car
